Java-like typed Stream for Python

This library heavily uses itertools for great performance and simple code.

## Examples
In [examples](./examples) are cool examples using Streams.

## Not yet asked questions

I'll try to answer questions that could occur.

### Which type-checkers do you support?

Currently only mypy is fully supported, because I couldn't get the others to work properly.

### Why are there no changelogs?

I'm too lazy. I don't know of anybody using this (except me) and I don't need to write changelogs for myself.
If you need changelogs, please create an issue.

### Why EUPL-1.2-or-later?

- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
- AGPL3 is too long
- [Google EUPL Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/thirdparty/licenses#european_union_public_licence_eupl_not_allowed)

### Is it production-ready?

Probably.
